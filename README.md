# Image Enhancement

Image enhancement with CNNs based on ["Deep Learning for Image Enhancement"](https://openhsu.ub.hsu-hh.de/handle/10.24405/14267), but implemented with PyTorch. The original work was implemented in matconvnet with certain custom functions and different batch-normalization implementation, which is not reflected here.
